                     Nintendo's all-star cast of combatants is back in Super Smash Bros. Melee, along with 
                     a new batch of brawlers ready to tear it up. The sequel to Super Smash Bros. keeps the 
                     same basic premise: Characters duke it out in interactive environments, using special 
                     attacks and various items to knock each other into the abyss. Some new defensive 
                     techniques add an even deeper level of complexity to the combat. In addition to 
                     traditional battle royale matches, players can select all-new ways to play like Coin 
                     mode and Tournament mode. </p>

                <p>Summary : <br>
                     Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets 
                     of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to 
                     Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his 
                     re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all 
                     does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice 
                     City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money 
                     back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. 
                     Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take 
                     over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For 
                     the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, 
                     a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that 
                     sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice 
                     City from the air?</p>

                     In A Link to the Past, Link answers Princess Zelda’s call for help against the dark 
                     wizard Agahnim, who seeks to free Ganon from his prison. Armed with the Master Sword, 
                     Link travels between the Light and Dark Worlds, rescues the seven maidens, and defeats

                     Four Swords introduces multiplayer Zelda gameplay for the first time. When Zelda is 
                     kidnapped by the wind sorcerer Vaati, Link draws the Four Sword, splitting into four 
                     versions of himself. Up to four players must cooperate to solve puzzles, conquer 
                     dungeons, and collect rupees before ultimately defeating Vaati and sealing him away 
                     once more.</p>

                     AN EVIL WIND IS RISING... Legend has it that whenever evil has appeared, a hero named

                     sail across a vast, unexplored ocean. * Master a magical conductor's baton known as the 
                     Wind Waker to control the wind and much more! * Connect to a pal's Game Boy® Advance and

                     By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding

                     the player's presence affects everything around him, from the physical environment to 
                     the behaviors -- even the emotions -- of both friends and enemies. The player again 
                     picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an 
                     alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace 
                     dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the 
                     wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people -- people he cares about -- 
                     are counting on him.</p>

                     Four years have passed since the aftermath of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and a great 
                     tension now smolders throughout the ravaged world of Azeroth. As the battle-worn races 
                     begin to rebuild their shattered kingdoms, new threats, both ancient and ominous, arise 
                     to plague the world once again. World of Warcraft is an online role-playing experience 
                     set in the award-winning Warcraft universe. Players assume the roles of Warcraft heroes 
                     as they explore, adventure, and quest across a vast world. Being "Massively Multiplayer," 
                     World of Warcraft allows thousands of players to interact within the same world. Whether 
                     adventuring together or fighting against each other in epic battles, players will form 
                     friendships, forge alliances, and compete with enemies for power and glory. A dedicated 
                     live team will create a constant stream of new adventures to undertake, lands to explore, 
                     and monsters to vanquish. This content ensures that the game will never be the same from 
                     month to month, and will continue to offer new challenges and adventures for years to come.</p>

                     Thrown into a parallel world by the mischievous actions of a possessed Skull Kid,

                     has wreaked havoc on the citizens of Termina, but their most urgent problem is a 
                     suicidal moon crashing toward the world. Link has only 72 hours to find a way to 
                     stop its descent.</p>
