                     Nintendo's all-star cast of combatants is back in Super Smash Bros. Melee, along with 
                     a new batch of brawlers ready to tear it up. The sequel to Super Smash Bros. keeps the 
                     same basic premise: Characters duke it out in interactive environments, using special 
                     attacks and various items to knock each other into the abyss. Some new defensive 
                     techniques add an even deeper level of complexity to the combat. In addition to 
                     traditional battle royale matches, players can select all-new ways to play like Coin 
                     mode and Tournament mode. </p>

                     Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets 
                     of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to 
                     Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his 
                     re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all 
                     does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice 
                     City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money 
                     back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. 
                     Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take 
                     over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For 
                     the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, 
                     a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that 
                     sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice 
                     City from the air?</p>

                     Four years have passed since the aftermath of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and a great 
                     tension now smolders throughout the ravaged world of Azeroth. As the battle-worn races 
                     begin to rebuild their shattered kingdoms, new threats, both ancient and ominous, arise 
                     to plague the world once again. World of Warcraft is an online role-playing experience 
                     set in the award-winning Warcraft universe. Players assume the roles of Warcraft heroes 
                     as they explore, adventure, and quest across a vast world. Being "Massively Multiplayer," 
                     World of Warcraft allows thousands of players to interact within the same world. Whether 
                     adventuring together or fighting against each other in epic battles, players will form 
                     friendships, forge alliances, and compete with enemies for power and glory. A dedicated 
                     live team will create a constant stream of new adventures to undertake, lands to explore, 
                     and monsters to vanquish. This content ensures that the game will never be the same from 
                     month to month, and will continue to offer new challenges and adventures for years to come.</p>

                     Gears of War blends tactical action with survival horror and thrusts gamers into a 
                     deep and harrowing story of humankind's epic battle for survival against the Locust 
                     Horde, a nightmarish race of creatures that surface from the bowels of the planet. 
                     Lead war hero Marcus Fenix and his fire team as they face the onslaught of merciless 
                     warrior fiends. A revolutionary tactical combat system and breathtaking, high-
                     definition visuals from the Unreal Engine 3 immerse you in a horrifying story of war 
                     and survival. A.I. teammates are indiscernable from human players. Voice recognition 
                     and real-time lip synching heighten the experience. The battlefield is a lethal place. 
                     To survive, suppress your enemy with blindfire, take cover in interactive 
                     environments, or use weapons and teammates to outwit your foes.</p>

                     Oblivion is a single-player game that takes place in Tamriel's capital province, 
                     Cyrodiil. You are given the task of finding the hidden heir to a throne that sits 
                     empty, the previous emperor having been killed by an unknown assassin. With no true 
                     Emperor, the gates to Oblivion (the equivalent of hell in the world of Tamriel) open, 
                     and demons begin to invade Cyrodiil and attack its people and towns. It's up to you 
                     to find the lost heir to the throne and unravel the sinister plot that threatens to 
                     destroy all of Tamriel. In keeping with the Elder Scrolls tradition, players have the 
                     option to experience the main quest at their own pace, and there are plenty of 
                     opportunities to explore the vast world and make your own way. Numerous factions can 
                     be joined, such as the thieves or mages guilds, and each contains its own complete 
                     storyline and the chance to rise to the head of the faction and reap further rewards. 
                     Oblivion features a groundbreaking new AI system, called Radiant AI, which gives non-
                     player characters (NPCs) the ability to make their own choices based on the world 
                     around them. They decide where to eat or who to talk to and what they say. They sleep, 
                     go to church, and even steal items, all based on their individual characteristics. 
                     Full facial animations and lip-synching, combined with full speech for all dialog, 
                     allows NPCs to come to life like never before.</p>

                     The ultimate Nintendo hero is taking the ultimate step ... out into space. Join Mario 
                     as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in 
                     the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives 
                     chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Mario, Peach and enemies new 
                     and old are here. Players run, jump and battle enemies as they explore all the planets 
                     in the galaxy. Since this game makes full use of all the features of the Wii Remote, 
                     players have to do all kinds of things to succeed: pressing buttons, swinging the Wii 
                     Remote and the Nunchuk, and even pointing at and dragging things with the pointer. 
                     Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he's done 
                     before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, 
                     pointing and shaking the Wii Remote. Shake, tilt and point! Mario takes advantage of 
                     all the unique aspects of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller, unleashing new moves 
                     as players shake the controller and even point at and drag items with the pointer.</p>

                     unique items critical to your very survival. Upgrade your weapons with ionic gels,

                     Super Mario Galaxy 2, the sequel to the galaxy-hopping original game, includes the gravity-

                        Fantastic musical score. But it's not a "me too" experience -- a significant majority of

                     Developed by Rockstar San Diego, as a follow up to the 2004 hit game Red Dead Revolver, Red 
                     Dead Redemption is a Western epic, set at the turn of the 20th century when the lawless and 
                     chaotic badlands began to give way to the expanding reach of government and the spread of the 
                     Industrial Age. The story of former outlaw, John Marston, Red Dead Redemption takes players 
                     on a great adventure across the American frontier. Utilizing Rockstar's proprietary Rockstar 
                     Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), Red Dead Redemption features an open-world environment for 
                     players to explore, including frontier towns, rolling prairies teeming with wildlife, and 
                     perilous mountain passes - each packed with an endless flow of varied distractions. Along 
                     the way, players experience the heat of gunfights and battles, meet a host of unique 
                     characters, struggle against the harshness of one of the world‚Äôs last remaining wildernesses, 
                     and ultimately pick their own precarious path through an epic story about the death of the 
                     Wild West and the gunslingers that inhabited it.</p>

                     BioWare completes the Mass Effect Trilogy with Mass Effect 3. Earth is burning. Striking from 
                     beyond known space, a race of terrifying machines have begun their destruction of the human 
                     race. As Commander Shepard, an Alliance Marine, the only hope for saving mankind is to rally 
                     the civilizations of the galaxy and launch one final mission to take back the Earth.</p>

                    <p>"In many ways, Mass Effect 3 has set the bar even higher as the worthy conclusion to one of 
                        the finest stories ever told in gaming history, even if it's still admittedly imperfect."</p>

                    <p>"Even if the end destination of this final chapter isn't quite as magnificent as we hoped 
                        for, we'll never regret the hundred-hour, three-game journey we took across the galaxy to 
                        get there. Mass Effect 3 is an incredible experience that rewards you for those years of 
                        investment and devotion to its stratospheric tale."</p>

                     FIFA 13 is the next iteration in the football[soccer] franchise - in handheld form.<br><br>
                     The FIFA video game series, published by Electronic Arts (EA) from 1993 until 2022, simulated 
                     association football, offering players a realistic football experience with real leagues, clubs, 
                     and players.</p>

                    <p>"Kinect works well. It's been implemented unobtrusively and in a way that makes sense."</p>

                    <p>"There are some annoyances--the physics engine feels like it's been overly tinkered, and the 
                        shortcomings of career mode's become apparent when you step out of Europe's top leagues. 
                        However, it succeeds at one key task that it sets out to do: render FIFA 12 obsolete. You 
                        can wear last year's jersey, but you won't want to play last year's game any longer."</p>
