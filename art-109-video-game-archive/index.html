                    three unique criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street

                    <p>"Stardew Valley is without a doubt the best game in the Harvest Moon genre in many years. It has
                        <br>
                        a subtle message about what it means to live a good life and to flourish through a combination
                        <br>
                        of hard work and human connection. The Harvest Moon games all basically boil down to managing a
                        <br>
                        mix of time, tasks, and metrics, and recent entries in the series have relied heavily on <br>
                        exploiting a new gameplay gimmick with each iteration: in one it's crafting structures for the
                        <br>
                        town, in another it's trading with foreign economies. The problem with this approach is that
                        <br>
                        once these gimmicks are exhausted — all the houses built or all the goods traded — the games
                        <br>
                        feel hollow. Stardew Valley succeeds by delivering a robust experience that does not merely rely
                        <br>
                        on watching a meter go up. It has something to say and says it well, while never abandoning the

                        core gameplay that attracted players in the first place."
