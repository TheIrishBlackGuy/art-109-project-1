                    once-important, formerly-known-as celebrities. The city was once the envy of the Western world, but

                    three unique criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street

                    gangster in search of real opportunities and serious cheddar; Michael, a professional ex-con whose

                    retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the

                    chance of a cheap high and the next big score. Quickly running out of options, the crew risks it all
                    <br>
                    in a sequence of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.
